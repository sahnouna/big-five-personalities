\section{Conclusions}\label{Sec:Conc}
The  hypothesis was that Women were opened and more conscious than men at the workplace. The  results of our work  do not  support at all this hypothesis.

We think the tests we ran went  smoothly and we had no problems, except for the fact that we observe a certain difference when working on Consciousness of a worker . Therefore, we had to take the measurements quickly. So we found that our theory was half true and half false (concerning the fact that women were more conscious than men).

An interesting future study might involve testing the effectiveness of the worker at the workplace such that we ask ourselves whether opened women are more effective than conscious men at the workplace
